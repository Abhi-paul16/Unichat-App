![Chat Application](https://i.ibb.co/GJwyy9m/Bv9-Js3-QLOLY-HD.jpg)

## Introduction

In this project, I create a full Realtime Chat Application with Social Auth and dedicated chat APIs/sockets.

I will learn how to build a react chat app using [https://chatengine.io](https://chatengine.io)

Firebase and Chat Engine are greats tools to setup apps fast and easily - great to learn with!

For watching live demo of this project just download the code and generate your own Apis from chat engine and put it on chats.js components on the place of process.env.React_APP_CHAT_ENGINE_ID/KEY and after that hit npm start in development server.

### Bonus - E-mail notifications

If you want to upgrade this chat application even further than what is shown in the Project, you can add e-mail notifications. More info on https://chatengine.io/docs/email_notifications.
